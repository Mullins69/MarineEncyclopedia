            Our Mission
          </h3>
          <p>
            Creating ocean partnerships to protect wildlife.

Saving Ocean Wildlife will be the resource for up-to-date information on Ocean wildlife, providing you with tools and opportunities to actively
engage with and support ocean wildlife. Partnerships will allow for cross-border collaborative relationships to improve research and protection for ocean wildlife. Saving Ocean Wildlife has three core programs. This summer we will begin with our Outreach program consisting of ocean awareness, engagement and action. Building upon that success we will begin our second program, Citizen Science: Land and Sea Monitoring and Reporting, this winter.
